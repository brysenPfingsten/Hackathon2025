# üïµÔ∏è realeyes.ai: Deepfake Detection & Awareness

## Team Members
- Aaron Stanway
- Brysen Pfingsten
- Collin Delbridge
- Dimitri Short
- Thorin Collins

## What We Built
- **Education Portal**: Learn what deepfakes are, how they're made, what they're used for, and how to spot them.
- **Interactive Guessing Game**: Test your ability to spot a deepfake. Can you beat the model?
- **Custom CNN Model**: We trained a convolutional neural network that detects deepfakes with 95% accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

### Run the App
Within Deepfakes run

```
docker-compose up --build
```
## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python
- **Model**: Custom-trained CNN (PyTorch)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
