    <p>
    A deepfake is a type of synthetic media where a person's likeness (face, voice, etc.) is replaced with someone else's using artificial intelligence. 
    The term combines "deep learning" and "fake." These sophisticated AI-generated forgeries can create realistic-looking videos, images, 
    or audio recordings that appear authentic but are completely fabricated.

    <p>
    Deepfake technology primarily uses machine learning techniques called autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs). 
    These AI models analyze and learn from large datasets of real images or videos of a person, then can generate new content featuring 
    that person saying or doing things they never actually did.
